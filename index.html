        <p>In hockey, there are six main positions: the goaltender (goalie), who protects the net and prevents goals; defensemen, who work to block shots, break up opposing plays, and help transition the puck up the ice; and forwards, who focus on scoring and creating offensive opportunities. Forwards consist of the center, who handles faceoffs, sets up plays, and supports both ends of the ice; the left wing, who plays on the left side and assists in scoring and passing; and the right wing, who plays on the right side with similar responsibilities. Together, these positions create a balanced team structure of offense and defense.</p>
        <p>In hockey, play stops for a few different reasons. A whistle blows when the puck is frozen by the goalie or if it goes out of play, like over the boards or off the netting. If a player commits a penalty, like tripping or slashing, there’s a stoppage for the penalty to be assessed. Icing happens when a player shoots the puck from their side of the ice all the way down past the other team’s goal line without anyone touching it, causing a faceoff back in their defensive zone. Offside is called when a player crosses the blue line into the attacking zone before the puck does, stopping play for a faceoff outside the zone. These stoppages give teams a moment to reset before jumping back into the action.</p>
        <p>Penalties in hockey occur when a player breaks the rules, and they result in the player serving time in the penalty box. Minor penalties last two minutes and can be for infractions like tripping, slashing, or hooking. If the opposing team scores during the penalty, the player is released early. Major penalties are five minutes long and are given for more serious offenses, like fighting or checking from behind. Misconduct penalties are for actions that disrupt the game, such as arguing with officials, and they last 10 minutes but don’t affect the team’s player count on the ice. Game misconducts send a player off for the rest of the game for serious offenses. Penalties leave the offending player’s team short-handed, giving the other team a power play, which increases their chances of scoring.</p>
